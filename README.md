# My first java proyect

## Register and login proyect
<p> 
In this project I have done something interesting, most of it was 
improvised and I say interesting because I didn't think that I 
would dedicate a few days to do something decent (in my current knowledge),
it is a project that I think is simple and meets at least Most of the functions
that I wanted it to have. It works as follows: 
</p>

1. [x] Register the data you enter and create an account for you (This can be seen in the userFiles folder).
2. [x] It allows you to log in to your account (It has some errors but it works for the most part).
3. [x] Enter the account section (I have left it as shown).

<p> 
You can freely use this project to improve it or do whatever you want, 
what I would like is for you to check it out and tell me what I can improve
to take it into account in future projects!
</p>
